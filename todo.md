# TODO

- refactor add/edit selector css and php instructions
- make is so delete joblisting pulls up alert instead of delete php
- double-check that all input including gets is sanitized properly (research 'get' for proper sanitizing)
- discovered two config files. /config.php and /config/config.php. figure out which in use, delete one and test.
